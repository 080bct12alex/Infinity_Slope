    Computer Graphics project : Rolling Ball on an Infinite Slope

This is a C++ program that implements a simple game using the graphics.h library. The game features a ball rolling down an inclined plane (infinity slope) while avoiding obstacles.
The keyconcept used in this project are Bresenham Algorithm , Flood fill Algorithm , rolling body on an inclined plane physics, DOUBLE BUFFER

This is the 3rd semester Computer Graphics PROJECT ,IOE Pulchowk Campus.
